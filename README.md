  Since 2006, 2,323 AMBER alerts have occured across the United States. About 200 alerts are generated per year, meaning over 200 children are abducted each year. These alerts almosts always include vital information for motorists to alert authorities if a given vehicle is spotted. This effort could be consolidated and improved using artificial intelligence to analyze traffic camera feed to search for vehicles of interest.
  
  Using the License Plate Recognition Program, a passive, yet more efficient approach can be taken to finding missing children. Instead of relying on the occupied memories of drivers across the country, an automated system can maintain a scalable search for important vehicles, notifying authorities when an involved vehicle is found.
